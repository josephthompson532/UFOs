# UFOs

## Overview


### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to create a web visualization for data on UFO sightings. By incorporating Javascript, HTML, and bootstrap, I was 
able to make an interactive and dynamic table that allows anyone to sort and filter UFO sightings by State, City, Country, and shape.

## Results
The whole page has been styled and colored using bootstrap and css. There is an initial title on a jumbotron and then an area for some text including 
several paragraphs speaking on the matter of UFO sightings.

The most imporessive and most dynamic portion of the web application is the table displaying UFO sighting data. Each sighting contains rows on date, 
city, state, country, shape, duration, and other comments which summarize the sighting. There are filters to the left of the table or all of these
categories which filter the table immediately upon being changed.

## Summary
One drawback of this design is that the data scrolls down for longer than seems necessary. Adding a page feature that allows you move between pages of 
results would save the user some time scrolling. The blank area below "UFO Sightings: Fact or Fancy" also seems odd. This should be remedied by adding 
a photo in said area.
